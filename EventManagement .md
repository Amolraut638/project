This is my first c++ project "Event management system ". In this project i have used the oop's concept to create classes and the functions
here is some imformation about this project
Event: Represents an event with details like ID, name, date, venue, and organizer.
Participant: Represents a participant with a unique ID, name, contact, and the eventID they are registered for.
Venue: Represents a venue with a unique ID, name, location, and capacity.
Schedule: Represents an event’s schedule, with a link to eventID, date, timeSlot, and venueID.
In the main() function, I’ve included basic options for adding and viewing events, participants, venues, and schedules
